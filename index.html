    <p>Hello, my name is <em>Samwel Mwaura.</em>. I'm a Telecommunication Engineer with a wide experience in Access Network Transmission, Radio Configuration and Maintenace of BSS elements.
    Currently I am a student at Moringa school learning DevOps and Cloud Computing.</p>
    <p>I decided to do programming as I find it an enormously flexible tool that I can use to do amazing things that are otherwise either manual and laborsome or are just impossible, 
    and if I cant solve the problems of the world I can at least solve my own problem using programming.
    If you have a project that I can help with,kindly get in touch.</p>
    <p>My hobies is watching a Sci-fi movie, reading the bible and I find meditating alone in a quiet environment very refreshing</Sci-fi></p>
