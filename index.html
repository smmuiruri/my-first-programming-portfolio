    <p>I decided to do programming as I find it an enormously flexible tool that I can use to do amazing things that are otherwise either manual and laborsome or are just impossible, 
    and if I cant solve the problems of the world I can at least solve my own problems using programming.
    If you have a project that I can help with,kindly get in touch.</p>
